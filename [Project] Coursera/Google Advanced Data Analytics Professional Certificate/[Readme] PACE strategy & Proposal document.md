### Develop churn project background
#### Meeting notes
After onboarding, you are given access to the company network and set up with a company email account (your first initial and last name, followed by @Waze).

Opening your inbox, you notice an email from your supervisor, May Santner. 

**From:**  “May Santner,” May@waze.com 

**Subject:** Your first task: Review meeting notes

If you are reading this message, then your company accounts have been created! Now is the perfect time to get started. Last week, I attended an internal meeting with our leadership team about a new project. You’ll receive more information in the next few days, but I’d like you to be aware of some key points made by leadership. Here is an excerpt from my meeting notes. I’ve organized the points by the person who made them.
##### Sylvester Esperanza, Senior Project Manager
   + The data team will need a global-level project document to outline project goals and milestones.
   + We will need to generate some visuals to share with the Waze executives.
##### Chidi Ga, Senior Data Analyst
   + The dataset has to be inspected before any analysis can begin.
   + The data team needs to learn more about the data through exploratory data analysis (EDA).
   + Eventually, our team will need to test the model to find out if it's delivering consistent results.
##### Harriet Hadzic, Director of Data Analysis
   + Before we share any insights, we'll need to determine whether or not our model meets the project requirements.
   + Once we finalize the model, I'll need to know the main talking points for our presentation to the leadership team.
##### My thoughts and concerns… 
   + I think it's best to use Python for this project. I'll have someone on my team set that up as soon as we have the project proposal in place.
       * It will be important to establish the relationship between key variables in the dataset. I'd suggest the data team consider hypothesis testing.

Review the meeting notes and proposed tasks from each team member to become familiar with the project’s context. I’ll ask you to identify project tasks and come up with a structure to guide the data team through this project. After our discussion about your experience in the Google certificate program, I know that your efficient communication style and strong problem-solving skills will help the data team achieve its goals. 

There will be more details sent to you soon.

Welcome to the team,

May Santner

(P.S. Don’t forget about our Data Superstars discussion group. Our next session is this Friday at 3pm. Each month, the team gets together to discuss the work of an innovative and inspiring historical figure. This month, it’s Ada Lovelace, often considered the world’s first computer programmer. This event is also a great opportunity to get to know your new teammates - and, if you want, try the outstanding coffee in the Waze cafe! Please join us!)

#### Project background
Waze’s data team is in the earliest stages of the churn project. The following tasks are needed before the team can begin the data analysis process:

        * Organize project tasks into milestones
        * Classify tasks using the PACE workflow
        * Identify relevant stakeholders

#### Your assignment
For your first assignment, Waze is asking for a project proposal that will create milestones for the tasks within this project.

**Subject:** Welcome to Waze!

**From:** “May Santner,” <ins>May@waze</ins>

Hello, and welcome to the team! 

We are so happy to have you. We have been growing quickly and we can really use your expertise. 

Leadership has asked our team to build a machine learning model that predicts user churn. The model will be based on a sample of Waze user data. An accurate model will help our company prevent user churn, improve user retention, and increase growth. 

For your first task, please draft a plan of action for the team. Include questions we need to answer before we get started on the project, important details to consider at the beginning of the project, and action items for different stages of the project. 

I understand you’ve completed a Google Careers Certificate on Advanced Data Analytics and learned the skills for planning, analyzing, constructing, and executing strategies for data science. Sylvester did one of the Google certificates and really loved it. They learned some incredible skills. Maybe you can use the skills you learned in that program to get started? 

I really appreciate your help. Again, welcome to the team!
