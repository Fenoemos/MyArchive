### Project background
Waze’s data team is working on the churn project. The following tasks are needed before the team can begin the data analysis process:
  + EDA and cleaning
  + Select and build visualization(s) type
    - Create plots to visualize variables and relationships between variables
  + Share your results with the data team

#### Your assignment
You will conduct exploratory data analysis on data for the churn project. You’ll also use tools to create visuals for an executive summary to help non-technical stakeholders engage and interact with the data.
___
### Scenario
Your team is making progress on their project to develop a machine learning model to predict user churn. 
So far, you’ve completed a project proposal and used Python to inspect and organize Waze’s user data.

You check your inbox and notice a new message from Chidi Ga, your team’s Senior Data Analyst. 
Chidi is pleased with the work you have already completed and requests your assistance with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and further data visualization. 
You also notice a follow-up email from the Director of Data Analysis, Harriet Hadzic. 
Harriet suggests including an executive summary of your analysis to share with teammates.

<sub>Hi there,

<sub>Thanks for the amazing work you’ve done so far. 

<sub>We’re ready to perform EDA on our user data. Has May told you what the leadership team expects when it comes to EDA? If not, think of it as a “show your work” kind of report. They will want to see a Python notebook showing the structuring and cleaning you did, and any data visualizations you created to better understand the data. To start, I suggest you create a box plot of the variable “drives,” and a scatter plot of the variables “drives” and “sessions.” Feel free to add any other visuals you think are useful. 

<sub>By the way, I cc’d our director, Harriet Hadzic, who is on the leadership team and will be reviewing our analysis. @Harriet, I want to keep you informed on our progress! 

<sub>Thanks!

<sub>Thanks for the update, Chidi!  

<sub>Welcome to the team. We’re so glad to have you. 

<sub>Along with the notebook, it would be really helpful if you included an executive summary of your analysis attached via email. 

<sub>I appreciate your help!
