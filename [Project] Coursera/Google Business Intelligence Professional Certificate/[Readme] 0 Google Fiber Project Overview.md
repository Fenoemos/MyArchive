### Background

Google Fiber provides people and businesses with fiber optic internet. Currently, the customer service team working in their call centers answers calls from customers in their established service areas. 
In this fictional scenario, the team is interested in exploring trends in repeat calls to reduce the number of times customers have to call in order for an issue to be resolved.

### Scenario

You are currently interviewing for a BI position on the Google Fiber call center team. As part of the interview process, they ask you to develop a dashboard tool that allows them to explore trends in repeat calls. 
The team needs to understand how often customers call customer support after their first inquiry. This will help leadership understand how effectively the team can answer customer questions the first time.
