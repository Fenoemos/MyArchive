### Scenario
The Google Fiber customer service teamâ€™s goal is to understand how often customers are calling customer support after their first inquiry; this will help leadership understand how effectively the team is able to answer customer questions the first time. 
The dashboard you create should demonstrate an understanding of this goal and provide your stakeholders with insights about repeat caller volumes in different markets and the types of problems they represent. As part of the interview process, they have asked you to create a dashboard that will: 
    - Help them understand how often customers are calling customer support after their first inquiry; this will help leadership understand how effectively the team is able to answer customer questions the first time
    - Provide insights into the types of customer issues that seem to generate more repeat calls
    - Explore repeat caller trends in the three different market cities
    - Design charts so that stakeholders can view trends by week, month, quarter, and year. 

Coming up, you are going to build on previous work to combine data from the tables into one reporting table you will use to develop a dashboard for stakeholders. The activities will guide you through uploading the data into your own project space, using SQL code in Dataflow or BigQuery, observing how stakeholders interact with data, and finalizing a reporting table to be used for the dashboard.
